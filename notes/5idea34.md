## 5.3 Actions

#### 1.

- Programs can be biased when not trained on all groups. In the video we learned that because the program didn't categorize different races it wasn't able to detect the face. The facial recognition software couldn't recognize darker skin tones.
- Bias can be unintentional. 

## 5.4 Actions

#### 1. 

- One crowdsource idea for csp would to have students submit their individual replit pages and use theo data to determine where students could seek the most improvement. Teachers could figure out what parts of the replit need to be polished up.

#### 2.

- One crowdsource idea for DNHS would be to get everyone to answer a survey for how long after school activities take and how much homework they are assigned. This could be used for people to see how little time some people truly have, and teachers could adjust homework assignments accordingly.

## 5.3 Notes

- Bias is very common in everyday life, and through computer programming, we should try to remove it.
- Bias can be unintentional
- Programs can be made to target specific groups, which is a form of bias, like in targeted advertising.
- Sometimes it can be harmful, but sometimes is can be beneficial.

## 5.4 Notes

- Feedback from users can help eliminate any biased and allow solutions for problems.
- Distributed Computing - give power/computing power for faster calculations.
- Citizen Science - scientific research conducted in a whole or part by distributed individuals, donâ€™t have to be scientists.
- Crowdsourcing is practice of obtaining input or info from a large number of people via the internet.
