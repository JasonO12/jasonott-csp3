#### Question 1: Ability to process large data sets
- My answer: A
- Correct answer: B

The number of statements in a program is least likely to affect how it will handle large data sets. The time of the process would be affected by the size of the data set, as large data sets will take longer to process.


#### Question 23: Compromising a user's personal privacy
- My answer: D
- Correct answer: A

A group of cookies stored by the user's web browser will have the greatest potential to compromise their privacy. A public key encryption is meant to be public and won't put a user at risk when it is accessed.

#### Question 24: Contents of an Internet packet
- My answer: D
- Correct answer: A

When data is transmitted throught the Internet, each packet will contain data as well as metadata that contains information about routing. 

#### Question 28: Data Compression and its use
- My answer: B
- Correct answer: D

Data files that are compressed can be returned to their original state. There are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data.

#### Question 29: Detecting errors in code to sum values in a list
- My answer: A
- Correct answer: C

Using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude if the program works. When testing another value like [9, 1, 4, 5], the program will not work as intended as it adds the first value twice.

#### Question 38: Metadata and data from a call using a cellphone
- My answer: B
- Correct answer: C

In this situation, the metadata can be processed to provide all phone numbers that were called by or placed to that person on top of the number of calls made on a certain date.

#### Question 50: RGB values in digital images
- My answer: D
- Correct answer: C

By converting the red, green, and blue values in each pixel into a single number, information has been lost that cannot be restored. A lossless transformation would be creating the negative reverse of each pixel color, as no data is lost.

#### Question 1 - Ability of parallel solution to improve efficiency
- My answer: B
- Correct answer: D

The efficiency of a solution that can be broken down into parallel portions is still limited by a sequential portion. Improvement in efficiency is not limitless.

#### Question 3 - Action that raises legal or ethical concerns
- My answer: D
- Correct answer: C

The use of material created by someone else without permission raises ethical concerns and can have legal consequences. Using a Creative Commons license to publish a derived work does not free the musician from having to first obtain permission.

#### Question 8 - Advantages of open source software 
- My answer: D
- Correct answer: C

Open-source software can be continually updated without the original developers once it becomes available to the public.

#### Question 25 - Benefit of RunRoutr 
- My answer: B
- Correct answer: C

The application can be used to connect users with other nearby users, which may encourage users to exercise together. This may have the effect of improving user health. The application only sends notifications to compatible users who are nearby. Since not all people will be considered compatible, users are unlikely to be able to identify all other users in the area.

#### Question 27 - Benefits of incremental and iterative development 
- My answer: A
- Correct answer: D

Unsolvable problems cannot be solved with an algorithm. Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.

#### Question 36 - Cause of video play count error 
- My answer: D
- Correct answer: A

When the value of the count exceeded the maximum value that can be represented by a fixed number of bits, the count overflowed and wrapped around to a negative number.

#### Question 38 - Challenge in analyzing data from many counties
- My answer: D
- Correct answer: B

It will be a challenge to clean the data from the different counties to make the data uniform. The way pollution data is captured and organized may vary significantly from county to county.

#### Question 40 - Citizen science for wildlife research 
- My answer: B
- Correct answer: D

Citizen science involves members of the general public participating in scientific research. Distributing the image analysis work to a larger group of individuals allows the work to be completed in less time.

#### Question 12 - Creative Commons
- My answer: B
- Correct answer: A

Creative Commons gives creators of digital content the ability to indicate how their works can be legally used and distributed, enabling broad access to digital information. Not all previously copyrighted work can be distributed with the Creative Commons license, only ones that were published with this license. 

#### Question 18 - Test cases for allPositive in a list
- My answer: D
- Correct answer: C

The following procedure will return the value 'true' as soon as it encounters a number in the list that is positive. If the number in the list is not positive, then the procedure returns 'false'. The program is suposed to return 'true' when all elements in a list are greater than zero. When testing ```[1, 2, 3]```, The program will return 'true' in all cases, which is thre intended output. When testing ```[-1, 0, 1]```, however, the program will return 'true' when it encounters the 1 on the final iteration, which causes 'true' to be returned. Not every number in the list is positive, so 'true' is not the intended output.

#### Question 30 - Relationship between Internet and World Wide Web 
- My answer: C
- Correct answer: D

The Internet is a network of interconnected networks, and the World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files that is accessed via the Internet. The World Wide Web is not a global network, it must be accessed via the Internet. 

#### Question 34 - Algorithm that would most benefit from a heuristic
- My answer: C
- Correct answer: B

A heuristic approach is when a problem is solved using a sufficient method that may not be optimal or efficient, but works in the end. Some examples are trial and error or making an educated guess. Finding a fast route testing n! possible routes is very inefficient as factorial functions will not run in a reasonable amount of time. In this situation, a heuristic approach can be used.

#### Question 38 - Consequence of using Creative Commons 
- My answer: D
- Correct answer: B

A Creative Commons license with no rights reserved allows the public to freely use the contents of the e-book or works under that license. People are not legally prevented from using content in other works, they are in fact allowed to do what they want with no further permission from the author. 

#### Question 41 - Encrypting and decrypting using public key cryptography 
- My answer: B
- Correct answer: D

In public cryptography, a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key and decrypted with the recipient’s private key. The sender's private key is not used for deccryption.
