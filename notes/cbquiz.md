#### Question 1: Ability to process large data sets
- My answer: A
- Correct answer: B

The number of statements in a program is least likely to affect how it will handle large data sets. The time of the process would be affected by the size of the data set, as large data sets will take longer to process.


#### Question 23: Compromising a user's personal privacy
- My answer: D
- Correct answer: A

A group of cookies stored by the user's web browser will have the greatest potential to compromise their privacy. A public key encryption is meant to be public and won't put a user at risk when it is accessed.

#### Question 24: Contents of an Internet packet
- My answer: D
- Correct answer: A

When data is transmitted throught the Internet, each packet will contain data as well as metadata that contains information about routing. 

#### Question 28: Data Compression and its use
- My answer: B
- Correct answer: D

Data files that are compressed can be returned to their original state. There are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data.

#### Question 29: Detecting errors in code to sum values in a list
- My answer: A
- Correct answer: C

Using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude if the program works. When testing another value like [9, 1, 4, 5], the program will not work as intended as it adds the first value twice.

#### Question 38: Metadata and data from a call using a cellphone
- My answer: B
- Correct answer: C

In this situation, the metadata can be processed to provide all phone numbers that were called by or placed to that person on top of the number of calls made on a certain date.

#### Question 50: RGB values in digital images
- My answer: D
- Correct answer: C

By converting the red, green, and blue values in each pixel into a single number, information has been lost that cannot be restored. A lossless transformation would be creating the negative reverse of each pixel color, as no data is lost.
