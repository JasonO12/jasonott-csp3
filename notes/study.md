## Week 5

#### Study Plan:

To prepare for the AP exam and the practice quizzes on CollegeBoard, I will review all of the past questions I got wrong on previous CollegeBoard tests. I may decide to make flash cards or set up a quizlet for them, or use already created quizlets online to help study. I will also go over a list of key terms so I understand each question.

#### Reflection:

After taking the quizzes, it is clear that I need to go over some big ideas to make sure I am completely ready for the AP test. For example, I need to review binary and some various subjects like parallel computing, encryption, and more. All of my corrections are documented on GH Pages so I can review them whenever I see fit.


## Week 6

#### Study Plan

To prepare for this week's Quiz, I will review my results from quizzes 1 and 2 on CollegeBoard. Some terms I misunderstood had to do with the way the internet works, and general questions about different aspects of the digital world we live in. I can make those into flash cards. I also need to review binary.

#### Reflection

I scored a 44/50 on this quiz, and I am improving from previous quizzes. Some of the same types of questions were missed from quiz 1 and 2, so I will need to continue to review those concepts.


## Week 7

#### Study Plan

To prepare for quiz 5, I will continue to review the same terms that I missed from the past 3 quizzes, as I still do not fully understand the concepts. I will also be sure to avoid making dumb mistakes while carrying out code segments by trying to write down the procedure on paper.

#### Reflection

I scored a 48/50 on this quiz, and I improved a lot. I am understanding all of the terms that I missed previously, but it won't hurt to continue to review them over the weekend. The questions I got wrong were dumb mistakes, like carrying out a code segment incorrectly.
