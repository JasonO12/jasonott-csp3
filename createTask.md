## Plan

My plan is to make a marbles game where a player plays against a computer. The player and the computer will each select a number of marbles 1-10, and they will then each guess if the other selected an even or odd number of marbles. If the player is right, they get a point displayed on a scoreboard at the top of the page. The same applies for the computer. The past inputs for number of marbles for both the player and computer are also listed at the top of the page using lists that get values appended to them.
